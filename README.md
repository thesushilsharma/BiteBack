# BiteBack
BiteBack is an AI-powered and blockchain-enabled platform that helps restaurants detect surplus food and transparently redistribute it to communities in need.

We use machine learning to identify excess inventory in real-time and blockchain to track donations with accountability, ensuring every meal goes where it's needed and nothing goes to waste.
